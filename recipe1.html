        <h2>About this Recipe:</h2>

        <p>The Millionaire Pie was was my grandfathers favorite dessert. We spent a lot of time together with my Mom's family when I was growing up.  My grandparents owned a house boat on the river and I have so many wonderful memories of our time together. Even though there were cramped quarters in the kitchen, my grandmother always served a fabulous family meal.  My favorites were barbequed country ribs, potato salad, and baked beans. Each family would bring a dessert, chips or a drink to finish out the meal.  Our go-to for family gatherings was always Millionaire Pies. This cool and creamy dessert was the perfect treat on a hot day in the sun.  The pineapple and mandarin oranges provide just the right amount of tartness to the creamy base of this pie. If you prefer, this dessert also works well frozen.  If you choose to freeze the pies, be sure to set them out for at least 30 minutes prior to serving to allow for easy cutting and serving.</p>

        <h3>Our Re-S-ipe:</h3>

        <p>I have memories of eating this cool and creamy Millionaire Pie since I was very young.  This has always been a staple at our family gatherings during the spring and summer when the weather is hot outside. Not only was this recipe an easy treat to throw together, it was my grandfather's favorite, and I loved him dearly.  Whenever my Mom made these pies for our family gatherings, I knew that she made them with love knowing it would please my grandfather to have them as our dessert. The ingredients in this recipe are specific to brand, where noted, and should be followed exactly as noted.  The pineapples and mandarin oranges must be fully drained before incorporating them into the creamy pie mixture, otherwise it wll not set-up properly.  Years ago, my Mom used the regular Cool Whip, but we have found that it does not seem as thick and creamy as it used to be, so in recent years we have substituted the Cool Whip Extra Creamy to achieve the same results.  The other brand name item I refer to in this recipe is the Eagle Brand condensed milk, it is our preference to use this brand in particular to achieve the most creamy results, although there are several store brands that are also good I recommend Eagle Brand for the best overall flavor.  If you are feeling adventurous, you could attempt a low sugar version of this recipe with sugar free Cool Whip and condensed milk but I do not have any experience with these alternatives.</p>
